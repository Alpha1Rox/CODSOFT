The file contains 4 tasks completed by me. Used Tkinter for some programs to make the output interface look cool.
A program rock,paper,scissor has two different files one is done according to the task rules and is basic but the other is made with Tkinter to make it more beautiful but that program can be executed once so user can only play once 
There are three image files used for rock,paper,scissorTkinter file.
